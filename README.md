## About *medy*

We want to make a medicine recommender. Currently, we use [ScispaCy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) pretrained model and NER pipeline to recognize **symptoms** in a medicine as the entities. We use the entities as features of a medicine and recommend it to users. 

## API 

We make a simple API to interact with the android app prototype. Please kindly check the repository [here.](https://github.com/cahyaasrini/medy-api)
